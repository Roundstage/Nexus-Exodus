# Nexus Exodus

- I'm going to rework this entire code and make it great again.

Nexus Exodus is a BYOND-based sandbox with PVP and RP features. Based in Dragon Universe.

This game has a lot of features. Transformations (such as Super Saiyan), customisation (stat builds), construction (the sandbox part comes here), and a lot of smaller things. 

# Compiling

To compile, you will need to setup a [BYOND](https://www.byond.com/) environment.

In other words, download BYOND and then open Dream Maker.

Then, go on ```file -> Open Environment``` and select the .dme from this project. Congratulations! Now you can go to ```Build -> Compile``` and then you will compile the code.

You will be rewarded with a .dmb file, which you can use to run locally or host using Dream Daemon.

Alternatively, you can go to our Releases and get the files directly to run.
